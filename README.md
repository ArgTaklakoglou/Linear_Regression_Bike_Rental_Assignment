# Linear_Regression_Bike_Rental_Assignment

In this assignment, I try to find what influences bike rental count hourly and I also try to predict it in order to satisfy demand.
Initially, I perform some descriptive data analysis and visualization (such as pairwise comparison) in order to gain insight into certain particularities of this 
dataset. Then, I try to build the best model for predicting the number of bike rentals per hour. I used Lasso as a screening method and stepwise methods in order to 
select the final model. Then I check the assumptions of the model and I interpret the parameters. Also, I check the predicting performance of the model and
I test the out-of-sample predictive ability of the model. Finally, I describe the typical profile of a day for each season (autumn, winter, spring, 
summer).
